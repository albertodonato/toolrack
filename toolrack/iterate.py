def flatten_dict(data, join_char='.', prefix=''):
    '''Flatten a nested dict to (key, value) tuples.

    A neted dict like::

      {'foo': {'bar': 3, 'baz': 4},
       'bza': 'something'}

    is flattened in a sequence of tuples like::

      ('foo.bar': 3), ('foo.baz': 4), ('bza': 'something')


    Parameters:
        - data: a dict to flatten.
        - join_char: the character to use to join key tokens.
        - prefix: an optional prefix to prepend to keys.
